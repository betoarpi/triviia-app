# Triviia App

This is a code challenge to create a trivia app in ReactJs, in my case I decided to use React Native.

## How to install:
- Open the project folder in your terminal.
- Run `npm install` to install all the project's dependencies
- Once all the dependencies are installed, run `expo start` to start up the project
- If you see a QR code, the project is ready. You can see some more instructions in case you want to open an iOS or Android simulator, but you can also scan the QR code to open it in the Expo App

## About the app:
Once you open the app in your device, you'll be able to play the quiz. You can select the difficulty and start playing.

### Enjoy the Triviia App!
